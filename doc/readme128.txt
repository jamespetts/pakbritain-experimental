How do I become millionaire?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not start big! Be careful and design system you can afford from starting
money.

Trains are intended to be long. 2-3 wagon train is usually lossy - except
for passenger units.

Press G (shift+g) and look at speed bonuses, goods with low bonus should go
slowly (cheaper), while goods with high bonus will pay much more for fast
service.

Most raw materials do not pay very well. Wood, stone, iron ore or grain are
not good stand alone money makers. You need to service whole industry tree
to make profit on higher level goods which pays much better. (look at income
graph)

Combine! Simutrans is about it. Make use of fact that goods can switch
vehicles on its route to destination and you get paid for each hop. Good
idea is to set high capacity train line and use trucks to collect materials
from larger area to keep trains busy.

Best paying goods among all are passengers. But it is difficult to setup
network big enough to attract enough of them. Only very experienced players
should try to start just with passengers, most players will rather setup
profiting goods service and use income to expend passenger transport.

Remember, number of passengers willing to use your service increases as
you cover more destinations. Do not let yourself to be annoyed because in the
very beginning you will hardly get a few travellers.
