# Settings for calibrating the revenue system
#
# These settings calibrate the way in which revenue is calculated in the game. Changing
# them might make the game easier or harder, or, if they are changed in odd ways, make it
# behave eratically. Make sure to know what you are doing before changing these values.

# These settings calibrate the speed bonus. Note that, with Simutrans-Experimental, unlike
# Simutrans-Standard, the speed bonus is based on the convoy or line's *average* speed, not
# the convoy's maximum speed. All distances in these settings are measured in tiles.
#
# min_bonus_max_distance is the distance below which the speed bonus (or penalty) does not
# apply. Below this distance, goods pay the same no matter what the average speed.
#
# median_bonus_distance is the distance at which 100% of the speed bonus/penalty applies. 
# At anything between min_bonus_max_distance and median_bonus_distance, a scaled proportion
# of the speed bonus applies. For example, if the min_bonus_max_distance was 10, and the 
# median_bonus_distance was 110, then, for a journey of 50 tiles, 50% of the speed bonus or
# penalty would apply. median_bonus_distance is optional: if it is not specified, or set to
# 0, it will be calculated as the mid point between min_bonus_max_distance and
# max_bonus_min_distance.
#
# max_bonus_min_distance is the distance above which the rate of the speed bonus increases
# no further. In other words, the rate of the speed bonus (or penalty) keeps increasing with
# the distance, until it reaches the max_bonus_min_distance, after which it remains steady.
#
# max_bonus_multiplier_percent is the percentage of the speed bonus that applies at or above
# the distance specified in max_bonus_min_distance. So, if the speed bonus rating was 10%, the
# distance exceeded the max_bonus_min_distance value, and the max_bonus_multiplier_percent was
# set to 200, the speed bonus rating would effectively be 20% for that journey.
# Between the median_bonus_distance and the max_bonus_min_distance, a scaled proportion applies.
# So, if, for example, the median_bonus_distance was 100, the max_bonus_min_distance was 1,100
# the actual distance 500, and the max_bonus_multiplier_percent 200, the speed bonus rating
# would be increased by half of the multiplier, or 150%.

# For comfort, and the revenues from catering and travelling post offices, the game needs to
# know the length of a journey. This is done by dividing the number of tiles by the average speed
# in kilometers per hour of the line or convoy, one tile representing one kilometer. However, this
# can produce very long journey times: travelling by 'bus at an average of 45kph or so accross a
# village can produce a journey time of 15-20 minutes, for example. This would make less comfortable, 
# but higher capacity vehicles for local transport pointless in most cases. 
#
# To counteract this, the journey_time_multiplier_precent is used. This enables the journey times to
# be reduced uniformly to match the approximate scale of the map as played. The default is 30, which
# reduces journey times to a third (which is somewhat more realistic in comparison to the size of
# and space between towns on a typical Simutrans map).

# These next settings affect the interaction between comfort and revenue in Simutrans. Comfort only
# affects passenger traffic, for obvious reasons. Passengers have a certain level of comfort that
# they will tolerate for certain distances. All comfort ratings are in the range of between 0 and
# 255. At the tolerable level, the revnue is unaffected. At above the tolerable level, a luxury
# bonus is applied. At below the tolerable level, a discomfort penalty is applied. The values can
# be set to anything, but, to reflect real life, it is suggested that the discomfort penalty is
# significantly higher than the luxury bonus. 
#
# tolerable_comfort_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle (0 - 255) for a journey of no
# more than tolerable_comfort_short_minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_short minutes.

# max_luxury_bonus_differential. So, if the tolerable comfort level for any given distance was 100, the 
# max_luxury_bonus_differential 50, and the max_luxury_bonus_percent 50, then the revenue would increase up to

# These settings control the revenue that can be earned from catering and travelling post offices. Note that catering

# and drink. 
#
# catering_min_minutes is the shortest journey time that will provide any catering revenue. Anything below that, and

# 
# The same applies for each subsequent catering level: in other words, higher catering levels only earn more than lower
# catering levels on journeys of at least the catering_levelX_minutes (where X is the catering level in question).
#
# Between each level, the a scaled proportion is applied. So, for example, if catering_min_minutes is 100, 
# catering_level1_minutes is 200, and the actual journey time is 150 minutes, then, any convoy with a catering level

# These settings determine how vehicles take corners, for each individual type of way.  They
# only apply to vehicles that use fixed ways (road, rail, monorail, etc.), and not aircraft or
# ships.
#
# Corner adjustment facotor (min/max) (%): The percentage of the normal speed limit applied
# on a 45 degree bend (for example, if the speed limit was 200kph, and the adjustment
# factor set to 50, the speed limit on the corner would be 100kph). 
# 
# Corner limit (min/max) (kph): The minimum and maximum speed limits for phasing of the 
# corner adjustment factor. On a way with the speed limit at or below the minimum limit,
# the minimum adjustment factor applies. On a way with the limit at or above the maximum
# speed limit, the maximum adjustment factor applies. Between the two, a phased proportion
# of the adjustment factor applies as a linear function of the difference between the two.
# For example, at halfway between the minimum and maximum speeds, halfway between the
# minimum and maximum adjustment factors apply.
#
# Direction steps (min/max) (number of tiles): The number of steps that the simulation takes
# into account when determining how sharp that a corner is. For example, if the number is set
# to 6, the corner speed limit will be based on the greatest difference in angle between the
# current direction and the direction in which the vehicle was travelling over the last 6 tiles.
# The higher the number, therefore, the more important that it is to have straight ways.
# Higher numbers should be set for railways and track based ways, and lower numbers for roadways.
# The direction steps are phased in the same way as the adjustment factor.
#
# Curve friction factor (x): The number of times extra friction that applies as a vehicle corners.
# Since the friction occasioned by cornering is not usually a significant speed limiting factor for
# most transport vehicles, it is recommended to set this to 0. It is preserved for those who prefer
# the old system of cornering.
#
# Reverting to the older cornering system: To make Simutrans behave in the conventional way (by
# using friction rather than speed limits to reduce speed in corners), set the minimum and
# maximum adjustment factors, and the minimum and maximum direction steps, to 1, and the friction
# factor to 8. With those settings, the minimum and maximum speed will be irrelevant.
