Colorful twins - offices of\nthe National Statistics\nInstitute. If you are not\ninterested in statistics,\nmaybe the story behind it\nis what you're waiting for.\nWell, here it goes: During\nconstruction it turned out\nthat the engineers and\narchitects had made a few\nmistakes in basic math,\nand as a result they built a\n30% smaller house. Luckily they\nused concrete pre-fabricated\nblocks so they were able to build\nanother very similar building only\ntwo meters away. But another\nmistake was made, and there\nwas no more cream color\nfor the\nsecond set of concrete blocks!\nOne of the construction company\nworkers quickly decided to\nprevent another fatal failure and\nused red instead. When two\nfloors were done, an angry\nInstitute director arrived and\ninsisted on having the cream\ncolor; the hapless worker was\nfired immediately to calm the\ndirector down. But you must\nadmit that now, after a few\nyears in which the bright red has\ndarkened a bit, it looks quite\nnice...\n\n
