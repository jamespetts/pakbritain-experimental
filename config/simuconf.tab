# Settings for calibrating the revenue system
#
# These settings calibrate the way in which revenue is calculated in the game. Changing
# them might make the game easier or harder, or, if they are changed in odd ways, make it
# behave eratically. Make sure to know what you are doing before changing these values.

# These settings calibrate the speed bonus. Note that, with Simutrans-Experimental, unlike
# Simutrans-Standard, the speed bonus is based on the convoy or line's *average* speed, not
# the convoy's maximum speed. 
#
# All distances in these settings are measured in kilometres and calibrated using the
# distance_per_tile setting.
#
# min_bonus_max_distance is the distance below which the speed bonus (or penalty) does not
# apply. Below this distance, goods pay the same no matter what the average speed.
#
# median_bonus_distance is the distance at which 100% of the speed bonus/penalty applies. 
# At anything between min_bonus_max_distance and median_bonus_distance, a scaled proportion
# of the speed bonus applies. For example, if the min_bonus_max_distance was 10, and the 
# median_bonus_distance was 110, then, for a journey of 50 tiles, 50% of the speed bonus or
# penalty would apply. median_bonus_distance is optional: if it is not specified, or set to
# 0, it will be calculated as the mid point between min_bonus_max_distance and
# max_bonus_min_distance.
#
# max_bonus_min_distance is the distance above which the rate of the speed bonus increases
# no further. In other words, the rate of the speed bonus (or penalty) keeps increasing with
# the distance, until it reaches the max_bonus_min_distance, after which it remains steady.
#
# max_bonus_multiplier_percent is the percentage of the speed bonus that applies at or above
# the distance specified in max_bonus_min_distance. So, if the speed bonus rating was 10%, the
# distance exceeded the max_bonus_min_distance value, and the max_bonus_multiplier_percent was
# set to 200, the speed bonus rating would effectively be 20% for that journey.
# Between the median_bonus_distance and the max_bonus_min_distance, a scaled proportion applies.
# So, if, for example, the median_bonus_distance was 100, the max_bonus_min_distance was 1,100
# the actual distance 500, and the max_bonus_multiplier_percent 200, the speed bonus rating
# would be increased by half of the multiplier, or 150%.

# distance_per_tile represents the length of each tile in tens of meters. So, at a setting of 1, 
# each tile would represent 10 meters. At a setting of 100, each tile would repreesnt 1 kilometre. 
# The default is 25. (In earlier versions, the default was 30). 
#
# This setting is used for calculating journey times, revenues, maintenance costs, comfort and
# catering values. In previous versions, it was known as the "journey_time_multiplier_percent".

distance_per_tile = 25

# These next settings affect the interaction between comfort and revenue in Simutrans. Comfort only
# affects passenger traffic, for obvious reasons. Passengers have a certain level of comfort that
# they will tolerate for certain distances. All comfort ratings are in the range of between 0 and
# 255. At the tolerable level, the revnue is unaffected. At above the tolerable level, a luxury
# bonus is applied. At below the tolerable level, a discomfort penalty is applied. The values can
# be set to anything, but, to reflect real life, it is suggested that the discomfort penalty is
# significantly higher than the luxury bonus. 
#
# tolerable_comfort_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle (0 - 255) for a journey of no
# more than tolerable_comfort_short_minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_short minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_median is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_median minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_long is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_long minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_long is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of at least
# tolerable_comfort_long minutes.
#
# For any journeys of a time between any of the values, a scaled proportion is taken. 
# 
# Note that (versions 7.2 onwards), the impact of comfort on revenue decreases with journey time.
# It is at its maximum level down to tolerable_comfort_median_long_minutes, after which it gradually
# reduces to 20% of its maximum at tolerable_comfort_short_minutes, and does not decrease further
# thereafter.

# max_luxury_bonus_differential is the maximum number of comfort rating points above the tolerable level
# that affects the luxury bonus. Anything beyond that, and further added luxury makes no difference to the
# revenue.
#
# max_luxury_bonus_percent is the percentage increase in revenue from the maximum level of luxury specified in
# max_luxury_bonus_differential. So, if the tolerable comfort level for any given travelling time was 100, the 
# max_luxury_bonus_differential 50, and the max_luxury_bonus_percent 50, then the revenue would increase up to
# 50% beyond the normal revenue for additional comfort up to 150, but would not increase further with any increase
# in comfort beyond 150.

# These settings control the revenue that can be earned from catering and travelling post offices. Note that catering
# vehicles on a convoy also increase the comfort by a small amount, which has an indirect effect on the revenue. These
# settings do not affect that: these settings affect the revenue earned from the catering itself: i.e., by selling food
# and drink. 
#
# catering_min_minutes is the shortest journey time that will provide any catering revenue. Anything below that, and 
# passengers will not bother to buy any food or drink at all. 
#
# catering_level1_minutes is the journey time at which any convoy with a catering level of 1 or higher will earn, per
# passenger, the number of Simu-cents (1/100th of a Simucredit) specified in catering_level1_max_revenue. 
# 
# The same applies for each subsequent catering level: in other words, higher catering levels only earn more than lower
# catering levels on journeys of at least the catering_levelX_minutes (where X is the catering level in question).
#
# Between each level, the a scaled proportion is applied. So, for example, if catering_min_minutes is 100, 
# catering_level1_minutes is 200, and the actual journey time is 150 minutes, then, any convoy with a catering level 
# of at least 1 will earn 50% of the amount specified in catering_level1_max_revenue per passenger.

# "Base car preference percent" is the chance, expressed in percentage, that, all

# car in preference to using public (i.e., the player's) transport. Higher values
# are more realistic; lower values make the game easier. 
# 
# "Always prefer car percent" is the percentage of drivers who prefer to use their

# deterred from using their car to go to or from (or within) towns that have a
# high level of congestion. The default is 10. 
#
# "Congestion density factor" is the factor by which the population density (in
# citizens per tile) is divided to get a factor multiplied by the number of cars
# per tile per month to get the congestion figure. In simple terms, the lower this
# number, the easier that it will be for cities to register as congested, and 
# the more likely that it is that passengers will opt for public (i.e., the player's)
# transport instead.

# To revert to the behaviour of Simutrans Standard (with no competition from private cars
